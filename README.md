<h1>Origins of this project</h1>
This web application was created for the intention of my mom being able to write her own recipes in a home server. This recipe would be saved in a local database. When a recipe is created you can select it and create a pdf out of the recipe. For this purpose, my mom could create here own recipe book. (That is why the project is called “recipe-book”).
If anyone finds it useful here is a piece of code that you can use to create a recipe book in the future.
Maybe out of this project I create a bigger project which has users that can subscribe to other user`s and see their recipes. Only time will tell.
